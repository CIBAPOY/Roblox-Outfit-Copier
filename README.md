# Roblox-Outfit-Copier
This Python script uses the Roblox API to change your Roblox character outfit to a person that you choose. You still need to own the items that you are putting on, but the program will prompt you to buy anything that you don't have (Unless it is in a bundle, it is a limited, or you cannot afford it).

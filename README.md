# Roblox-Outfit-Copier
This Python script uses the Roblox API to change your Roblox character outfit to a person that you choose. You still need to own the items that you are putting on, but the program will prompt you to buy anything that you don't have (Unless it is in a bundle, it is a limited, or you cannot afford it).

How to use:

Step 1: Download Main.py and cookie.txt.

Step 2: Open cookie.txt and delete all of the text in there and replace it with your cookie (If you don't know how to get your cookie, you probably shouldn't be using this program.)

Step 3: Run Main.py and enter the Roblox id of the players outfit that you would like to copy.

Step 4: From there on it will pompt you with the items that the player is wearing and tell you to type y/n if you would like to buy the item or not.

Step 5: Have fun!
